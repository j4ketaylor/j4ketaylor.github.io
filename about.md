## About me

Hello, I'm Jake, a Biomedical Engineering graduate from Imperial College London with a keen interest in the fusion between transport and IT.

My website is currently a log of my three month travels around Germany, but I aim to fill it with transport related programming projects that I am working on throughout the next few months.
