## About me

Hello, I'm Jake, a Biomedical Engineering graduate from Imperial College London with a keen interest in the fusion between transport and IT.

My website is currently fairly empty, and serves as a dumping ground for transport related ideas, plus some journeys that I have completed. I am always adding new things so do check back for new additions!
