## About my travel logs

Since my arrival in Germany, I have kept a record of every train, bus, and tram used during my journey. Each day shows each of these journeys colour-coded corresponding to the colour of these routes on official maps.

I hope to visualise all of these journeys graphically after the completion of my trip.
