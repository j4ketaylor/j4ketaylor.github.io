[^1]: Okay here I should put something about "ipsum".
[^2]: same goes for this.
[^3]: I studied latin in high school but im not able to translate *anything*! By the way this is a longer footnote and i think it is still pretty cool, even prettier than shortier ones even though it does not say anything useful but whatever.
